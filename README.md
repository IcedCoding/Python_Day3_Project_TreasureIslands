Welcome to **Treasure Island**! This is a simple, fun, text-based adventure game built with Python. The goal? Find the hidden treasure without falling into any deadly traps!

## 🎮 How to Play

You'll be presented with a series of choices throughout the game. Your decisions will determine whether you find the treasure or face a "Game Over".

2. If you choose the correct path, you'll encounter a lake and decide whether to **wait** for a boat or **swim**.
